Anyway, I'll try.

I'm Hazem Samir Ashmawy, a computer engineering student at Alexandria University. 
I'm expected to graduate in July 2018.

This summer of 2017, I have the opportunity to be part of **Google's** search
infrastructure team as a software engineering intern at Google office in 
Mountain View. In summer 2016 I had the opportunity to work on a research 
project with a PHD student at [QCRI](http://www.qcri.org.qa/) in Qatar.

Computer science is a really big and interesting field, I'm interested in a wide
spectrum of topics including: Machine Learning, Parallel Programming, Media and
video streaming and compression, compilers and system tools and many more.

Oh man, I'm such a terrible seller!
